# Divvy_Chicago_BikeSharing


## Background
- June 28, 2019 will mark the sixth Anniversary of Divvy. As the only major bike sharing  system in Chicago, the blue bikes have become a regular mode of transportation for Chicagoans since its inception. (reaching more than 20k rides per day in peak seasons).
- One year ago, Divvy provided its 15 millionth ride and its expected to pass 20 millionth mark by the end of 2019 / early 2020.

## Recent Development
- March 2019, Lyft, which took over Divvy-operator Motivate, was given the exclusive rights for 9 years to operate the city-owned bike-sharing system and is proposing to invest US$50 million to:
- Add 175 stations and 10,500 bikes
- Expand to all 50 city wards by 2021

## Project Objectives
To assist with the expansion plan, our team developed a relational database that will enable quick response and analysis on the current state Divvy operations in regard to ridership, station locations and various other factors affecting them. And:
- Provide methodologies and various tools used in the process
- Provide data analysis and visualization
- Put forward a future state blueprint for the new stations and bikes allocation process

## Tools
- OpenRefine
- SQL
- Tableau
- R
- Python
